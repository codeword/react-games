# React Games

This is a playground project to try out some React patterns.

It's currently a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript though I would like to
conver it to fully to TS.

 - Feel free to clone/fork and use as you like
 - PR's welcome
 - Issues welcome but this is a pet side project and though I'm not sure
   if/when I would get to them, I would like the feedback.
